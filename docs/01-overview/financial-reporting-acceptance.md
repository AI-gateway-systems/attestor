# AI-Assisted Financial Reporting Acceptance

Attestor should now be read as an **AI output release and acceptance layer**, with **AI-assisted financial reporting acceptance** as the first proving wedge.

That is narrower than "enterprise AI platform" and stronger than a vague "AI governance" label.

The core claim is simple:

- an AI system can help produce reporting work
- that output is still only a proposal until it earns release into consequence
- Attestor is the layer that decides whether that output may move forward, under what conditions, with what authority, and with what evidence

## Why Finance Is The First Wedge

Financial reporting already assumes explicit structure, packaging, validation, identity, and accountability.

That makes it a strong proving ground for a release layer:

- report sections and metrics become durable records
- filing packages become formal artifacts
- reviewer authority matters
- silent errors are expensive
- later verification matters as much as first-pass generation

If the release model survives here, it earns the right to travel.

## What "Acceptance" Means Here

In this wedge, acceptance does not mean "someone glanced at it."

It means a reporting workflow can show:

- what output was proposed
- what consequence it was trying to trigger
- what data and tool boundaries applied
- what deterministic checks passed or failed
- who, if anyone, authorized release
- what evidence and verification material survived afterward

## Current Official Anchors

Current official anchors as of **2026-04-17**:

- [SEC: EDGAR Filer Manual](https://www.sec.gov/submit-filings/edgar-filer-manual)

- [XBRL Report Package specification](https://specifications.xbrl.org/work-product-index-report-package-report-package-1.0-report-package-1.0.html)

None of those documents says "buy Attestor." Together they do show why plain model output is not enough once AI starts touching real reporting consequence.

## The Canonical Attestor Demonstration

The clearest current product proof is still:

1. run the live hybrid counterparty scenario
2. emit a signed proof packet
3. verify the packet outside Attestor

Commands:

```bash
npm run showcase:proof:hybrid
npm run verify:cert -- .attestor/showcase/latest/evidence/kit.json
```

## What The Buyer Story Should Sound Like

Not:

- generic AI governance platform
- another agent framework
- a filing workspace

Instead:

- an AI output release and acceptance layer
- a hosted API/control layer for reporting workflows that need release discipline, proof, and reviewer closure
- a customer-operated deployment path when the release boundary cannot stay hosted

## Boundary

Attestor is not the reporting stack. ERP, warehouse, filing, and human control
systems remain the systems of record.

Attestor sits between generated output and reporting consequence, and makes
that boundary legible.
